# TAB2XML
A Music application that converts a given music tablature into music score. 
## Description
TAB2XML is a Java application that converts music tablature into MusicXML, a file format 
that represents musical notation. However, reading a MusicXML file is a tedious task. 
The new update introduces the ability to preview any specific MusicXML file created from a 
given tablature into Music Scores for better understanding. 

Additionally, the new update includes two other features. Playing the notes 
(currently only for guitar tablature) and ability to print/save as Pdf. 

Currently, only guitar and drum tablature are supported, but more instruments and additional 
features, such as allowing the user to navigate to specific measures, will be added in future 
releases.
